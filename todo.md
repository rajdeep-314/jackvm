# To do

- Try running the test case files provided in the VM emulator
- Write a parser
- Get rid of the helper functions after the parser is made
- Once the parser is made, maybe try out the OS libraries
- Before submitting, go through the `.org` file in sir's repository, to sync the "format"

- Change push and pop implementation for the static segment?
- Enable compiling multiple files?
